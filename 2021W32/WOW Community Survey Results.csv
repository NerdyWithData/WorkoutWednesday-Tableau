It has given me the opportunity to try out new things , challenge myself and use those skills at work for improvement . Thanks a lot and hope to see many more unique challenges in future. It would be great if most of them are business-focused and related to client requirements so that we get to know how the expectations are with clients and how could we solve the same. Thanks again.",
